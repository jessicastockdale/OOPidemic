\title{Plot a transmission tree for a disease outbreak}
\usage{
plot_transmission_tree(x, rooted = TRUE, edge_length = "transmission")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A Population or Group object that has had it's outbreak simulated}

\item{rooted}{Logical. Should the tree be rooted at the index cases}

\item{edge_length}{Which interval the edge lengths should be proportional to
\itemize{
\item "serial": Use serial interval
\item "generation": Use the generation time
\item "transmission": Use the transmission interval (default)
}}
}
\value{
A visNetwork plot
}
